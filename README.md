# TSA-Webmasters-SmartwatchForCommunities

To find what foreign wearable technology we wanted to focus our website on we searched up the different foreign wearable technologies. Through this we found many types of wearable technologies such as smart glasses, watches, rings, shirts, and belts. Of these technologies we decided that watches were the best because the other wearables are some that people might not want to wear or like. Smartwatches also already play a role in society and are used by many people willingly. It also seemed like a technology that many would not mind including in their daily lives. It was implemented in the real world compared to rings or glasses which might be avoided because of aesthetics or comfort. In conclusion, we thought smartwatches would be the easiest to implement in the real world.
